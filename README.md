# nivita-birthday-extension

I made this Chrome extension for my friend's birthday and secretly installed it on her computer.  It replaces small words like "the" and "if" with birthday messages (in English, Chinese, and Hindi), replaces images with funny Snapchats, and displays a large banner with another birthday message. (The images are not included for privacy reasons.)
